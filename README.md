# A-financial-aid-database-pipeline-

# Overview

This project gives us an insight to the international movement of money,services or goods from
government or international institutions for the benefit of the receiving country or citizens.
This project aims to show the trail of how the income from different organisation comes in and
what countries that are in need and  gets to experience this benefit by engineering a robust data pipeline that
cleans, processes,stores data collected and visualizes the data from the financial aid dataset.


# Project Goals


One of the main objective of this project was to assist the federal financial aid group in setting up a SQL SERVER database to store and manage data from their yearly financial aid process. To achieve this, I was tasked with the following:
Clean and preprocess the financial aid csv dataset.
Design a database schema to accommodate the yearly process.
Implement an ETL pipeline using pandas for data manipulation and SQL for database operations.
Design a power bi visualization board to observe how much grant they got and how its being distributed based on country.

# Tools Used
pandas: For data manipulation,cleaning the data set and connecting it to sql server using sqlalchemy

SQL SERVER: As the database management system to store and manage the campaign data.

Excel: used it to store the outcome of the data from sql server 

Powerbi: it was used  to visualize the financial aid dataset
